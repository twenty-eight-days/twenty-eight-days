= 28 Days

A React web application which tracks & visualizes cycle data.

All data is stored via https://userbase.com/[Userbase], a secure persistence service.
To use the app with your private cycle data, you thus need a userbase account (instructions below).

The web application itself then manages & displays your cycle data.
It is publicly available (i.e. you don't have to deploy your own copy):

https://twenty-eight-days.github.io/twenty-eight-days

If you just want to have a look at some mock data, there's a *demo mode*:

=== Personal Userbase Account

[WARNING]
====
The app is still in early alpha stage!
On-boarding is very raw and only recommended for developers.
While your data is always encrypted and will not leak, you might experience loss or corruption.
====

Your personal cycle data is hosted through userbase, a service providing encrypted databases.
The starter plan is *free* and offers 1 app with 100 users, which is enough for our purpose.

First, you need to https://v1.userbase.com/#create-admin[create an admin account].

Userbase will create a https://v1.userbase.com/#app=Starter%20App[Starter App] for you.
Copy the *App Id* to somewhere safe, it is needed to identify your database.

Now that you have an id, you can add a new database user via the (very experimental!) sign-up form:

* Open the form: https://twenty-eight-days.github.io/twenty-eight-days?signUp
* Fill in credentials (password min 6 characters)
* _In case of errors, check dev console for details_

If the sign-up process is *successful*, your new user will already be signed in – you are all set and can start tracking your cycle data! ✨

[TIP]
====
* You won't need the sign-up form again, so just use the https://twenty-eight-days.github.io/twenty-eight-days[plain URL] from now on
* Users can be deleted via the userbase admin panel
====

==== Auto-Login

Having to fill in the login form for every usage of the app can be tedious.
There are two options to minimize this hassle:

In *production*, you can pass your `appId` as a query string:

----
https://twenty-eight-days.github.io/twenty-eight-days?appId=1234-abcd-1234-abcd-xyz
----

This will allow the app to perform an auto-login with your previously used username/password.

During *development*, you can store your credentials *locally*, in an `.env.local` file placed in the project root:

[title=.env.local]
----
REACT_APP_USERBASE_APP_ID=1234-abcd-1234-abcd-xyz
REACT_APP_USERBASE_USERNAME=test
REACT_APP_USERBASE_PASSWORD=testtest
----

[WARNING]
====
* Obviously, you shouldn't commit this file to VCS (it is listed in `.gitignore`)
* Clear this file before triggering a deployment from your local machine
====

== Development

=== CRA

This app is based on https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app[create-react-app], so the usual tooling is available:

First time dependency installation:
----
yarn install
----

Auto-refreshing dev mode:
----
yarn start
----

=== Deployment To GitHub Pages

* Update version in `package.json`
* `git tag v1.2.3`
* `yarn deploy` (be aware of `.env.local`)
* `git push`
* `git push --tags`
